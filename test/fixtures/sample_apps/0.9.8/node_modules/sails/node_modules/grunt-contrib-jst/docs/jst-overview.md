_This plugin uses [the Lo-Dash library](http://lodash.com/) to generate JavaScript template functions. Some developers generate template functions dynamically during development. If you are doing so, please be aware that the functions generated by this plugin may differ from those created at run-time. For instance, [the Underscore.js library](http://underscorejs.org/) will throw an exception if templates reference undefined top-level values, while Lo-Dash will silently insert an empty string in their place._
