It is designed to resemble the MVC architecture from frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the more modern, data-oriented style of web app development.  It's especially good for building realtime features like chat.\n\n\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the latest stable release with the command-line tool:\n```sh\nsudo npm -g install sails\n```\n\n\n## Creating a New Sails Project\n\nCreate a new app\n```sh\n# Create the app\nsails new testProject\n```\n\nLift Sails\n```sh\n# cd into the new folder\ncd testProject\n\n# Fire up the server  \nsails lift\n```\n\nThe default port for Sails is 1337, so at this point, if you visit <a href=\"http://localhost:1337/\">http://localhost:1337/</a>, you'll see the default home page.\n\nNow, let's get Sails to do cool stuff.\n\n\n## Creating a RESTful JSON API\n\nSails.js API blueprints are nothing like scaffolds. Generated forms just don't make sense for modern web apps (no one uses them!)\nInstead, Sails allows you to generate a powerful RESTful JSON API using the command line tool.\nThis is exactly what you need for [AJAX web pages](http://irlnathan.github.io/sailscasts/blog/2013/10/10/building-a-sails-application-ep22-manipulating-the-dom-based-upon-changes-via-real-time-model-events/), [realtime apps](http://lanyrd.com/2013/nodepdx/video/), [SPAs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di50_eHqI7I), [Backbone apps](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/working-with-data-in-sails-js/), [Angular apps](https://github.com/rdroro/tulipe-personal-todolist), [Cordova/PhoneGap apps](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sailsjs/o7HaB0rvSKU), [native mobile apps](https://github.com/aug2uag/SampleAppiOS), [refrigerators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tisWSKMPIg8), [lamps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmcQZD_LIAE), etc.\n\nWithout writing any code, Sails supports:\n  + filtering (`where`)\n  + search (`or`, `and`, `in`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `contains`, `greaterThan`, `lessThan`, `not`)\n  + sorting (`sort`)\n  + pagination (`limit`, `skip`, `sort`)\n  + JSONP\n  + CORS\n  + csrf protection\n\nBest of all, all of these things work with both HTTP _and_ WebSockets, and work across any of the supported database adapters, including PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and MySQL.  Authentication and access control are implemented using [policies](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/0.9/policies.md).  More on all that stuff here:\n\n[![Creating a REST API with Sails.js](http://i.imgur.com/drtMlWH.png)](//www.youtube.com/embed/xlOolpwwGQg?feature=player_embedded) [![Original Sails.js Screencast from March 2013](http://balderdashy.github.com/sails/images/screenshot.png)](http://youtu.be/GK-tFvpIR7c)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n###### Enough talk!  Let's generate a User API.\n\n\nWe'll need an empty model and controller:\n```\nsails generate user\n```\n\nIf you check out your app, you'll notice that this created a file at **/api/models/User.js** and **/api/controllers/UserController.js**.  \n\nNow, if you send a POST request to `http://localhost:1337/user` or visit `http://localhost:1337/user/create`, you'll see:\n```json\n{\n  \"createdAt\": \"2013-01-10T01:33:19.105Z\",\n  \"updatedAt\": \"2013-01-10T01:33:19.105Z\",\n  \"id\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThat's it!  You just created a model in the database!  You can also `find`, `update`, and `destroy` users:\n\n```bash\n# List of all users\nhttp://localhost:1337/user\n\n# Find the user with id 1\nhttp://localhost:1337/user/1\n\n# Create a new user\nhttp://localhost:1337/user/create?name=Fisslewick\n(or send an HTTP POST to http://localhost:1337/user)\n\n# Update the name of the user with id 1\nhttp://localhost:1337/user/update/1?name=Gordo\n(or send an HTTP PUT to http://localhost:1337/user/1)\n\n# Destroy the user with id 1\nhttp://localhost:1337/user/destroy/1\n(or send an HTTP DELETE to http://localhost:1337/user/1)\n```\n\n\n> #### JSONP, CORS, CSRF?\n> This built-in API bundles optional support for JSONP-- and in general, Sails has built-in support for CORS, and CSRF protection.\n> See your project's `config/cors.js`, `config/csrf.js`, and `config/controllers.js` files for more options.\n\n\n## Custom Controllers\n\nThese automatically generated URL routes are called \"blueprints\".  Blueprints may be disabled, pluralized, or prefixed globally or on a per-controller basis.\n\nBut what if you need more customized logic?  \n\nSay, your `UserController.create` needs to also send a confirmation email-- no problem.\nJust write a custom `create` method in your `UserController` and it will be available using the same blueprint routes (e.g. `POST /user`)\n\n\nCustom controllers are just Express middleware, the de facto standard for writing server code in Node.js. \n\ne.g.\n```javascript\n// api/controllers/UserController\nmodule.exports = {\n  /**\n   * @param {String} email\n   * @param {String} name\n   */\n  create: function (req, res) {\n    User.create({\n      name: req.param('name'),\n      email: req.param('email')\n    })\n    .exec(function userCreated(err, newUser) {\n    \n      // Bail out if there's an error!\n      // (this will use the app-global logic in config/500.js)\n      if (err) return res.serverError(err);\n      \n      // Send some email\n      require('my-favorite-email-module').send({\n        html: 'Well that\\'s neat.',\n        to: newUser.email\n      });\n      \n      sails.log('New user created successfully!');\n      sails.log.verbose('Confirmation email sent to', newUser.email);\n      \n      // Send JSON response\n      return res.json(newUser);\n    })\n  }\n};\n```\n\n\n\n> Worth noting is that the custom controller above still supports WebSockets out of the box, since Sails will actually simulate `req` and `res` objects when it receives properly-formatted messages from Socket.io.\n> Check out `assets/js/app.js` in your project for an example of how to use Socket.io to talk to your Sails backend.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Custom Routes\n\nYou can also define custom routes, controllers, and controller methods (aka \"actions\").\n\n```sh\nsails generate controller hello index\n```\n\nThis will generate a file called `HelloController.js` in your app's `api/controllers` directory with one action, `index()`.\n\nNow let's edit that action to send back the string `'Hello World!'`.\n\n```javascript\n// api/controllers/HelloController.js\nmodule.exports = {\n\n  index: function(req, res) {\n    // Here, you can do all the Express/Connect things!\n    res.send('Hello World!');\n  }\n};\n```\n\n\nLet's say we want the application to display this hello response specifically when a request comes in for `http://localhost:1337/hi`. \nGo into the **/config/routes.js** file and add a route like this:\n\n```javascript\n// config/routes.js\nmodule.exports = {\n\t'/hi': 'HelloController.index'\n};\n```\n\nFinally, restart the server by going to your node terminal and pressing control+c. Then enter the following.\n\n```sh\nsails lift\n```\n\nNow when you visit <a href=\"http://localhost:1337/hi\">http://localhost:1337/hi</a>, or send a Sails-formatted Socket.io message to `/hi`:\n```\n// Try this from the Chrome/Firebug javascript console on your app's home page:\nsocket.get('/hi', function (response) { console.log(response); });\n```\n\nYou'll see:\n\n```\nHello World!\n```\n\n\n\n## Documentation & Resources\n\n#### Official Documentation\n[Docs](http://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs)\n\n#### FAQ\nhttps://github.com/balderdashy/sails/wiki\n\n#### SailsCasts\nShort screencasts that take you through the basics of building traditional websites, single-page/mobile apps, and APIs using Sails.

We design/build scalable Node.js apps for startups and enterprise customers.\n\nAfter building a few realtime JavaScript apps and taking them into production, we realized that the Node.js development landscape was very much still the Wild West.  Over time, after trying lots of different methodologies, we decided to crystallize all of our best practices into this framework.  I hope it saves you some time :)\n\n\n\n\n<!-- ![icon_circlelightbulb@2x.png](http://i.imgur.com/eOFXn.png)  -->\n\nLicense\n--\n\nSails is built around so many great open-source technologies that it would never have crossed our minds to keep it proprietary.  We owe huge gratitude and props to TJ Holowaychuk ([@visionmedia](https://github.com/visionmedia)) and Guillermo Rauch ([@guille](https://github.com/guille)) for the work they did, as well as the stewards of all the other open-source modules we use.  Sails could never have been developed without your tremendous contributions to the node community.\n\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n--\n\nCopyright © 2012-2013 Mike McNeil\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
